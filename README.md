# Compare-n-Share
To support collectors of certain documents (doc, mp4, mp3, pdf, txt, images..) to exchange easily even if millions of files.
##Purpose of the scripts
We are collectors of certain files and the items include eBooks, pdf, doc, txt, images, audio, video etc; in short: all kinds of documents in files. And I already have a 7 TB hard drive with a few million files on it.
    - Every now and then I meet a similar collector (same special interests)
    - and we want to exchange: what I do not have, what he has and vice versa.
    - And it is impossible to compare this manually, because there are millions of files and he organizes them in a different folder tree than I do. So any existing folder comparison software will fail.
    - and all 7 TB in 100`000+ folders
To make matters worse, the collectors rename the files and reorganize the folders to use the file system to add document attributes. This makes it even harder to find redundant files.
